    "The greatest advantage of Leave-one-out cross-validation is that it doesn’t waste much data. We use only one sample from the whole dataset as a test set, whereas the rest is the training set. But when compared with k-Fold CV, LOOCV requires building n models instead of k models, when we know that n which stands for the number of samples in the dataset is much higher than k. It means LOOCV is more computationally expensive than k-Fold, it may take plenty of time to cross-validate the model using LOOCV.\n",
